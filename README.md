## Why not use X programming language?

I'm honestly more than comfortable using typescript, and I honestly believe I can write clean and fast code using it.
If I were to use Rust I would have to put away all of my other projects to learn Rust, I've tried learning it before, and I 
just can't do it, Maybe in the future if I have time (and a good enough reason: performance, etc...) I will, but 
for now I'll be sticking with TypeScript.
